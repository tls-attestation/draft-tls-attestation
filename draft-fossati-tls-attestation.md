--- abstract

The TLS handshake protocol allows authentication of one or both peers using static, long-term credentials.
In some cases, it is also desirable to ensure that the peer runtime environment is in a secure state.
Such an assurance can be achieved using attestation which is a process by which an entity produces evidence about itself that another party can use to appraise whether that entity is found in a secure state.
This document describes a series of protocol extensions to the TLS 1.3 handshake that enables the binding of the TLS authentication key to a remote attestation session.
This enables an entity capable of producing attestation evidence, such as a confidential workload running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), or an IoT device that is trying to authenticate itself to a network access point, to present a more comprehensive set of security metrics to its peer.
These extensions have been designed to allow the peers to use any attestation technology, in any remote attestation topology, and mutually.

#  Introduction

Attestation {{-rats-arch}} is the process by which an entity produces evidence about itself that another party can use to evaluate the trustworthiness of that entity.
This document describes a series of protocol extensions to the TLS 1.3 handshake that enables the binding of the TLS authentication key to a remote attestation session.
As a result, a peer can use "attestation credentials", consisting of compound platform evidence and key attestation, to authenticate itself to its peer during the setup of the TLS channel.
This enables an attester, such as a confidential workload running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) {{-teep-arch}}, or an IoT device that is trying to authenticate itself to a network access point, to present a more comprehensive set of security metrics to its peer.
This, in turn, allows for the implementation of authorization policies at the relying parties that are based on stronger security signals.

Given the variety of deployed and emerging attestation technologies (e.g., {{TPM1.2}}, {{TPM2.0}}, {{-rats-eat}}) these extensions have been explicitly designed to be agnostic of the attestation formats.
This is achieved by reusing the generic encapsulation defined in {{-cmw}} for transporting evidence and attestation result payloads in the TLS Certificate message.

The proposed design supports both background-check and passport topologies, as described in {{Sections 5.2 and 5.1 of -rats-arch}}.
This is detailed in {{evidence-extensions}} and {{attestation-results-extensions}}.
This specification provides both one-way (server-only) and mutual (client and server) authentication using attestation credentials, and allows the attestation topologies at each peer to be independent of each other.

This document does not specify any attestation technology.
Companion documents are expected to define specific attestation mechanisms.

# Conventions and Terminology

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the vocabulary and concepts defined in
{{Section 4 of -rats-arch}}, and those in {{Section 2 of -rats-kat}}.

The following terms are used in this document:

{: vspace="0"}

TLS Identity Key (TIK):
: A cryptographic key used by one of the peers to authenticate itself during the
TLS handshake.

TIK-C, TIK-S:
: The TIK that identifies the client or the server, respectively.

TIK-C-ID, TIK-S-ID:

: An identifier for TIK-C or respectively, TIK-S. This may be a fingerprint 
(cryptographic hash) of the public key, but other implementations are possible.

"Remote attestation credentials", or "attestation credentials", is used
to refer to both attestation evidence and attestation results, when no
distinction needs to be made between them.

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Overview

The basic functional goal is to link the authenticated key exchange of TLS with an interleaved remote attestation session in such a way that the key used to sign the handshake can be proven to be residing within the boundaries of an attested TEE.
The requirement is that the attester can provide evidence containing the security status of both the signing key and the platform that is hosting it.
The associated security goal is to obtain such binding so that no replay, relay or splicing from an adversary is possible.

Throughout the document, we will assume the conceptual attester model described in {{Section 3 of -rats-kat}}, where TEE attestation is provided by a Platform Attestation Token (PAT) signed by the attester's "attesting environment".
Among other security metrics, the PAT contains evidence about the integrity of a "Key Attestation Service" executing within the TEE which issues a Key Attestation Token (KAT) for the TLS handshake signing key (TIK) as described in {{handshake-overview}}.

The protocol's security relies on the verifiable binding between these two logically separate units of evidence.

# Attestation Extensions

As typical with new features in TLS, the client indicates support for the new
extension in the ClientHello message. The newly introduced extensions allow
remote attestation credentials and nonces to be exchanged. The nonces are used
for guaranteeing freshness of the exchanged evidence when the background check
model is in use.

When either the evidence or the attestation results extension is successfully
negotiated, the content of the corresponding Certificate message contains a
payload that is encoded based on the wrapper defined in {{-cmw}}.
Both JSON and CBOR serializations are allowed in CMW, with the emitter choosing which serialization to use.

In TLS a client has to demonstrate possession of the private key via the
CertificateVerify message, when client-based authentication is requested. The
attestation payload must contain assertions relating to the client's TLS
Identity Key (TIK-C), which associate the private key with the attestation
information. These assertions may come in the form of a Key Attestation Token
(KAT), or of specific claims in an attestation result document. An example of a
KAT format utilizing the EAT format can be found in {{I-D.bft-rats-kat}}.

The relying party can obtain and appraise the remote attestation results either
directly from the Certificate message (in the passport model), or by relaying
the evidence from the Certificate message to the verifier and receiving the
attestation results. Subsequently, the attested key is used to verify the
CertificateVerify message.

When using the passport model, the remote attestation results obtained by the
attester from its trusted verifiers can be cached and used for any number of
subsequent TLS handshakes, as long as the freshness policy requirements are
satisfied.

This protocol supports both monolithic and split implementations. In a monolithic
implementation, the TLS stack is completely embedded within the TEE. In a split
implementation, the TLS stack is located outside the TEE, but any private keys
(and in particular, the TIK) only exist within the TEE. In order to support
both options, only the TIK's identity and its public component are ever
passed between the Client or Server TLS stack and its Attestation Service.

# Use of Remote Attestation Credentials in the TLS Handshake

For both the passport model (described in section 5.1 of {{RFC9334}}) and
background check model (described in Section 5.2 of {{RFC9334}}) the following
modes of operation are allowed when used with TLS, namely:

- TLS client is the attester, 
- TLS server is the attester, and
- TLS client and server mutually attest towards each other. 

We will show the message exchanges of the first two cases in sub-sections below.
Mutual authentication via attestation combines these two (non-interfering)
flows, including cases where one of the peers uses the passport model for its
attestation, and the other uses the background check model.

## Handshake Overview {#handshake-overview}

The handshake defined here is analogous to certificate-based authentication in a regular TLS handshake. Instead of the certificate's private key, we use
the TIK identity key. This key is attested, with attestation being carried
by the Certificate message. Following that, the peer being attested proves possession of the private key using the CertificateVerify message.

Depending on the use case, the protocol supports peer authentication
using attestation only, or using both attestation and a regular public
key certificate.

The current version of the document assumes the KAT/PAT construct of 
{{I-D.bft-rats-kat}}. Not all platforms support this model, and a document
that defines private key attestation for use in TLS Attestation as defined here, must specify:

* The format and the lifetime of TIK (e.g. an ephemeral, per session TIK vs.
a long lived one).
* How the key is attested using a structure carried by the
Certificate message.
* How proof of possession is performed.

## TLS Client Authenticating Using Evidence 

In this use case, the TLS server (acting as a relying party) challenges the TLS
client (as the attester) to provide evidence. The TLS server needs to provide a
nonce in the EncryptedExtensions message to the TLS client so that the
attestation service can feed the nonce into the generation of the evidence. The
TLS server, when receiving the evidence, will have to contact the verifier
(which is not shown in the diagram).

An example of this flow can be found in device onboarding where the 
client initiates the communication with cloud infrastructure to 
get credentials, firmware and other configuration data provisioned
to the device. For the server to consider the device genuine it needs
to present evidence.

## TLS Server Authenticating Using Evidence

In this use case the TLS client challenges the TLS server to present evidence. 
The TLS server acts as an attester while the TLS client is the relying party. 
The TLS client, when receiving the evidence, will have to contact the verifier 
(which is not shown in the diagram).

An example of this flow can be found in confidential computing where 
a compute workload is only submitted to the server infrastructure 
once the client/user is assured that the confidential computing platform is
genuine.

The encoding of the evidence structure is defined in {{-cmw}}.

In this use-case the nonce negotiated by the two peers is not used directly as
an input to the attestation evidence generation mechanism. Instead, it is used
in the derivation steps for a channel binder.

### Channel binding

As described in {{usage-variants}}, this authentication mechanism is meant
primarily for carrying platform attestation evidence to provide more context to
the relying party. This evidence must be cryptographically bound to the TLS
handshake to prevent relay attacks. A channel binder value plays this role,
allowing a TLS handshake and a remote attestation session to be linked together
in a way that is verifiable by the relying party.

Creation of the channel binder relies on a new TLS exporter, the Handshake
Exporter. The Handshake Exporter, in turn, uses a new secret value
(handshake_exporter_secret) derived as part of the key schedule.
handshake_exporter_secret is derived from Handshake Secret using Derive-Secret,
with "h exp master" as the label and a handshake context stretching from
ClientHello to ServerHello. This derivation step is shown in
{{figure-handshake-exporter-secret}}.

The Handshake Secret is used to generate the TLS Handshake Exporter value as
defined in {{figure-handshake-exporter}}. This exporter becomes available after
the ServerHello message, and must be offered by implementation as a separate API
(i.e., TLS-Handshake-Exporter) to the TLS-Exporter and TLS-Early-Exporter.

~~~~
{: #figure-handshake-exporter title="Definition of the TLS Handshake Exporter."}

Using this new exporter, the channel binder is then defined as a call to
TLS-Handshake-Exporter with "attestation-binder" as the label, and the nonce
negotiated between attester and relying party as context. This is shown in
{{figure-channel-binder}}, where nonce-seed is the negotiated nonce. 

~~~~
channel_binder = TLS-Handshake-Exporter("attestation-binder", nonce-seed, nonce-size)
      = HKDF-Expand-Label(Derive-Secret(handshake_exporter_secret, "attestation-binder", ""),

~~~~
{: #figure-channel-binder title="Usage of TLS Handshake Exporter for channel binding."}

channel_binder must be computed by both peers: the attester must use it as a
challenge value when generating attestation evidence; the relying party must
verify its correct inclusion in the evidence it received during the handshake.
Both parties must adjust the size of channel_binder to the length advertised by
the attester.

## Background Check Model

### Client Hello

To indicate the support for passing evidence in TLS following the 
background check model, clients include the evidence_proposal 
and/or the evidence_request extensions in the ClientHello.

The evidence_proposal extension in the ClientHello message indicates
the evidence types the client is able to provide to the server,
when requested using a CertificateRequest message.

The evidence_request extension in the ClientHello message indicates
the evidence types the client challenges the server to 
provide in a subsequent Certificate payload.

The evidence_proposal and evidence_request extensions sent in
the ClientHello each carry a list of supported evidence types,
sorted by preference.  When the client supports only one evidence
type, it is a list containing a single element.

The client MUST omit evidence types from the evidence_proposal 
extension in the ClientHello if it cannot respond to a request
from the server to present a proposed evidence type, or if 
the client is not configured to use the proposed evidence type 
with the given server.  If the client has no evidence types 
to send in the ClientHello it MUST omit the evidence_proposal
extension in the ClientHello.

The client MUST omit evidence types from the evidence_request
extension in the ClientHello if it is not able to pass the 
indicated verification type to a verifier.  If the client does 
not act as a relying party with regards to evidence processing
(as defined in the RATS architecture) then the client MUST 
omit the evidence_request extension from the ClientHello.

### Server Hello

If the server receives a ClientHello that contains the
evidence_proposal extension and/or the evidence_request
extension, then three outcomes are possible:

-  The server does not support the extensions defined in this
   document.  In this case, the server returns the EncryptedExtensions
   without the extensions defined in this document.

-  The server supports the extensions defined in this document, but
   it does not have any evidence type in common with the client.
   Then, the server terminates the session with a fatal alert of
   type "unsupported_evidence".

-  The server supports the extensions defined in this document and
   has at least one evidence type in common with the client.  In
   this case, the processing rules described below are followed.

The evidence_proposal extension in the ClientHello indicates
the evidence types the client is able to provide to the server,
when challenged using a certificate_request message.  If the
server wants to request evidence from the client, it MUST include the
evidence_proposal extension in the EncryptedExtensions. This
evidence_proposal extension in the EncryptedExtensions then indicates
what evidence format the client is requested to provide in a
subsequent Certificate message.  The value conveyed in the
evidence_proposal extension by the server MUST be selected from one of the
values provided in the evidence_proposal extension sent in the
ClientHello.  The server MUST also send a certificate_request
message.

If the server does not send a certificate_request message or none 
of the evidence types supported by the client (as indicated in the
evidence_proposal extension in the ClientHello) match the
server-supported evidence types, then the evidence_proposal
extension in the ServerHello MUST be omitted.

The evidence_request extension in the ClientHello indicates what
types of evidence the client can challenge the server to return
in a subsequent Certificate message. With the evidence_request 
extension in the EncryptedExtensions, the server indicates the 
evidence type carried in the Certificate message sent by the server.
The evidence type in the evidence_request extension MUST contain 
a single value selected from the evidence_request extension in 
the ClientHello.

## Passport Model

### Client Hello

To indicate the support for passing attestation results in TLS following the
passport model, clients include the results_proposal and/or the results_request
extensions in the ClientHello message.

The results_proposal extension in the ClientHello message indicates the verifier
identities from which it can relay attestation results, when requested using a
CertificateRequest message.

The results_request extension in the ClientHello message indicates the verifier
identities from which the client expects the server to provide attestation
results in a subsequent Certificate payload.

The results_proposal and results_request extensions sent in the ClientHello each
carry a list of supported verifier identities, sorted by preference.  When the
client supports only one verifier, it is a list containing a single element.

The client MUST omit verifier identities from the results_proposal extension in
the ClientHello if it cannot respond to a request from the server to present
attestation results from a proposed verifier, or if the client is not configured
to relay the results from the proposed verifier with the given server. If the
client has no verifier identities to send in the ClientHello it MUST omit the
results_proposal extension in the ClientHello.

The client MUST omit verifier identities from the results_request extension in
the ClientHello if it is not configured to trust attestation results issued by
said verifiers. If the client does not act as a relying party with regards to
the processing of attestation results (as defined in the RATS architecture) then
the client MUST omit the results_request extension from the ClientHello.

### Server Hello

If the server receives a ClientHello that contains the results_proposal
extension and/or the results_request extension, then three outcomes are
possible:

-  The server does not support the extensions defined in this document.  In this
   case, the server returns the EncryptedExtensions without the extensions
   defined in this document.

-  The server supports the extensions defined in this document, but it does not
   have any trusted verifiers in common with the client. Then, the server
   terminates the session with a fatal alert of type "unsupported_verifiers".

-  The server supports the extensions defined in this document and has at least
   one trusted verifier in common with the client.  In this case, the processing
   rules described below are followed.

The results_proposal extension in the ClientHello indicates the verifier
identities from which the client is able to provide attestation results to the
server, when challenged using a certificate_request message.  If the server
wants to request evidence from the client, it MUST include the results_proposal
extension in the EncryptedExtensions. This results_proposal extension in the
EncryptedExtensions then indicates what verifier the client is requested to
provide attestation results from in a subsequent Certificate message.  The value
conveyed in the results_proposal extension by the server MUST be selected from
one of the values provided in the results_proposal extension sent in the
ClientHello.  The server MUST also send a certificate_request message.

If the server does not send a certificate_request message or none of the
verifier identities proposed by the client (as indicated in the results_proposal
extension in the ClientHello) match the server-trusted verifiers, then the
results_proposal extension in the ServerHello MUST be omitted.

The results_request extension in the ClientHello indicates what verifiers the
client trusts as issuers of attestation results for the server. With the
results_request extension in the EncryptedExtensions, the server indicates the
identity of the verifier who issued the attestation results carried in the
Certificate message sent by the server. The verifier identity in the
results_request extension MUST contain a single value selected from the
results_request extension in the ClientHello.

# Background-Check Model Examples

## Cloud Confidential Computing

In this example, a confidential workload is executed on computational
resources hosted at a cloud service provider.  This is a typical
scenario for secure, privacy-preserving multiparty computation,
including anti-money laundering, drug development in healthcare, contact
tracing in pandemic times, Machine Learning (ML) model training, etc.

In such scenarios, the users (e.g., the party providing the data input for the
computation, the party consuming the computed results, or the party
providing a proprietary ML model used in the computation) have two goals:

- Identifying the workload they are interacting with,
- Making sure that the platform on which the workload executes is a
  Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) with the expected features.

A convenient arrangement is to verify that the two requirements are met
at the same time that the secure channel is established.

The protocol flow, alongside all the involved actors, is captured in
{{figure-cc-example}} where the TLS client is the user (the relying
party) while the TLS server is co-located with the TEE-hosted
confidential workload (the attester).

The flow starts with the client initiating a verification session with a
trusted verifier.  The verifier returns the evidence types it
understands and a nonce that will be used to challenge the attester.

The client starts the TLS handshake with the server by supplying the
attestation-related parameters it has obtained from the verifier.  If
the server supports one of the offered evidence types, it will echo it
in the specular extension and proceed by invoking a local API
(represented by `attest_key(...)` in the figure below) to request
attestation using the nonce supplied by the verifier.  The returned
evidence binds the identity key (TIK-S) with the platform identity and
security state, packaged into a CAB.  The server then signs a transcript
hash with the (attested) identity key, and sends the attestation
evidence and the signature in the Certificate and the CertificateVerify
messages respectively. The transcript hash, denoted `hs` in the figure
below, follows the `Transcript-Hash` definition from {{Section 4.4.1 of
-tls13}}.

The client forwards the attestation evidence to the verifier using the
previously established session, obtains the attestation result (AR) and
checks whether it is acceptable according to its local policy.  If so,
it proceeds and verifies the handshake signature using the corresponding
public key (for example, using the PoP key in the KAT evidence
{{I-D.bft-rats-kat}}).

The attestation evidence verification combined with the verification of
the CertificateVerify signature provide confirmation that the presented
cryptographic identity is bound to the workload and platform identity,
and that the workload and platform are trustworthy.  Therefore, after
the handshake is finalized, the client can trust the workload on the
other side of the established secure channel to provide the required
confidential computing properties.

## IoT Device Onboarding

In this scenario, an IoT device is connected to a remote device management entity, which could be a cloud service provider or a network operator.
We assume that, initially, the remote device management entity does not trust the device.

The device management entity's responsibility is to guarantee that the device is running the intended software version, has not been tampered with, and is not being emulated or cloned.

The protocol flow is shown in {{figure-iot-example}} where the client 
is the attester while the server is the relying party.

The flow starts with the client initiating a TLS exchange with the TLS
server operated by the cloud service provider. The client indicates
what evidence types it supports.

The server obtains a nonce from the verifier, in real-time or from a
reserved nonce range, and returns it to the client alongside the
selected evidence type. Since the evidence will be returned in the
Certificate message the server has to request mutual authentication
via the CertificateRequest message.

The client, when receiving the EncryptedExtension with the
evidence_proposal, will proceed by invoking a local API to request the
attestation.  The returned evidence binds the identity key (TIK-C) with
the workload and platform identity and security state, packaged into a
CAB.  The client then signs a transcript hash of the handshake context
and the client's Certificate message  with the (attested) identity key,
and sends the evidence together with the signature over to the server.

The server forwards the attestation evidence to the verifier, obtains 
the attestation result and checks that it is acceptable according to its 
local policy. The evidence verification combined with the verification of
the CertificateVerify signature provide confirmation that the presented
cryptographic identity is bound to the platform identity, and that the 
platform is trustworthy.

If successful, the server proceeds with the application layer protocol 
exchange. If, for some reason, the attestation result is not satisfactory
the TLS server will terminate the exchange.

# Security Considerations {#sec-cons}

TBD.

# Privacy Considerations {#priv-cons}

In this section, we are assuming that the Attester is a TLS client, representing an individual person.
We are concerned about the potential leakage of privacy sensitive information about that person, such as the correlation of different connections initiated by them.

In background-check mode, the Verifier not only has access to detailed information about the Attester's TCB through Evidence, but it also knows the exact time and the party with whom the secure channel establishment is attempted (i.e., the RP).
The privacy implications are similar to online OCSP {{-ocsp}}.
While the RP may trust the Verifier not to disclose any information it receives, the same cannot be assumed for the Attester, which generally has no prior relationship with the Verifier.
Some ways to address this include:

* Client-side redaction of privacy-sensitive evidence claims,
* Using selective disclosure (e.g., SD-JWT {{-sd-jwt}} with EAT {{-rats-eat}}),
* Co-locating the Verifier role with the RP,
* Utilizing privacy-preserving attestation schemes (e.g., DAA {{-rats-daa}}), or
* Utilizing Attesters manufactured with group identities (e.g., {{FIDO-REQS}}).

The latter two also have the property of hiding the peer's identity from the RP.

Note that the equivalent of OCSP "stapling" involves using a passport topology where the Verifier's involvement is unrelated to the TLS session.

Due to the inherent asymmetry of the TLS protocol, if the Attester acts as the TLS server, a malicious TLS client could potentially retrieve sensitive information from attestation evidence without the client's trustworthiness first being established by the server.

# IANA Considerations

## TLS Extensions

IANA is asked to allocate four new TLS extensions, evidence_request,
evidence_proposal, results_request, results_proposal, from the "TLS
ExtensionType Values" subregistry of the "Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Extensions" registry {{TLS-Ext-Registry}}.  These extensions are used in the
ClientHello and the EncryptedExtensions messages. The values carried in these
extensions are taken from TBD.

## TLS Alerts

IANA is requested to allocate a value in the "TLS Alerts"
subregistry of the "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters" registry
{{TLS-Param-Registry}} and populate it with the following entries:

- Value: TBD1
- Description: unsupported_evidence
- DTLS-OK: Y
- Reference: [This document]
- Comment:

- Value: TBD2
- Description: unsupported_verifiers
- DTLS-OK: Y
- Reference: [This document]
- Comment:

## TLS Certificate Types

IANA is requested to allocate a new value in the "TLS Certificate Types"
subregistry of the "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions"
registry {{TLS-Ext-Registry}}, as follows:

-   Value: TBD2
-   Description: Attestation
-   Reference: [This document]

# Design Rationale: X.509 and Attestation Usage Variants {#usage-variants}

The inclusion of attestation results and evidence as part of the TLS
handshake offers the relying party information about the state of the
system and its cryptographic keys, but lacks the means to specify a stable
endpoint identifier. While it is possible to solve this problem by
including an identifier as part of the attestation result, some use cases
require the use of a public key infrastructure (PKI). It is therefore
important to consider the possible approaches for conveying X.509
certificates and attestation within a single handshake.

In general, the following combinations of X.509 and attestation usage are
possible:

1. X.509 certificates only: In this case no attestation is exchanged in the
    TLS handshake. Authentication relies on PKI alone, i.e. TLS with X.509
    certificates.
2. X.509 certificates containing attestation extension: The X.509
    certificates in the Certificate message carry attestation as part of
    the X.509 certificate extensions. Several proposals exist that enable
    this functionality: 
    - Custom X.509 extension:
      - Attester-issued certificates (e.g., RA-TLS {{RA-TLS}}): The
      attester acts as a certification authority (CA) and includes the
      attestation evidence within an X.509 extension.
      - DICE defines extensions that include attestation information in
      the "Embedded CA" certificates (See Section 8.1.1.1 of {{DICE-Layering}}).
      - Third party CA-issued certificates (e.g., ACME Device Attestation
      {{I-D.acme-device-attest}}): Remote attestation is performed between
      the third party CA and the attester prior to certificate issuance,
      after which the CA adds an extension indicating that the certificate
      key has fulfilled some verification policy.
    - Explicit signalling via existing methods, e.g. using a policy OID in
      the end-entity certificate.
    - Implicit signalling, e.g. via the issuer name.
3. X.509 certificates alongside a PAT: This use case assumes that a keypair
    with a corresponding certificate already exists and that the owner
    wishes to continue using it. As a consequence, there is no
    cryptographic linkage between the certificate and the PAT. This
    approach is described in {{pkix-attest}}.
4. X.509 certificates alongside the PAT and KAT: The addition of key
    attestation implies that the TLS identity key must have been generated
    and stored securely by the attested platform. Unlike in variant (3),
    the certificate, the KAT, and the PAT must be cryptographically linked.
    This variant is currently not addressed in this document.
5. Combined PAT/KAT: With this variant the attestation token carries
    information pertaining to both platform and key. No X.509 certificate
    is transmitted during the handshake. This approach is currently not
    addressed in this document.
6. PAT alongside KAT: This variant is similar to (5) with the exception
    that the key and the platform attestations are stored in separate
    tokens, cryptographically linked together. This approach is covered by
    this document in {{attest-only}}. A possible instantiation of the KAT
    is described in {{I-D.bft-rats-kat}}.
